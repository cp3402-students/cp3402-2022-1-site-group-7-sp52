Theme Overview & Description

Although, various attachments and functions of the websites can be changed via Wordpress, the main expression of the look, feel and other factors come from the theme itself. Theme plays an important role in deciding how the site will look and its aspects.
Learning center theme is a fully customizable & neat theme which brings minimalist look and elegant style. Our theme is suitable for blog, personal portfolio, or any commercial websites.


Theme Origin

Our learning center theme was created using a starter theme from underscores. This gives us a starting codebase from which the starter theme was modified and developed into our current learning center theme. 


Theme Installation

Within wordpress left menu panel:
1.	Visit – Appearance > Theme > Add New >
2.	Upload our theme zip file or  Search for “Learning center theme “ by enzos19
3.	Install and activate



Theme Folder Overview

The theme learning center can be found within ‘wp-content/theme’ area. Inside the learning center folder contains sub-folders and files which assemble the appearance and layout of the theme. These files are important for editing and maintaining the theme. Down below shows the basic overview of the folder structure, important sub-folders and files and the way they work.

learning center theme(main folder)
. style.css : the style.css file contains a number of important elements and was automatically added to the file structure when the starter theme was "sassified" in site origin builder plugin. The style.css contains the majority of custom code that gets output to the .css file.
. js (sub-folder): This JS folder is where you can make any changes to functions that you wish.
. LICENSE: The license file was created by site origin builder plugin and contains a standard GNU General Public License, version 2 license. This file is necessary to have contained within the theme directory and provides information on use of the theme. This is not intended to be modified.



Theme Features

We came down with an idea of keeping our theme to a minimalistic approach and elegant style, so we included only a few key features.


One-column layout
We decided on a minimalist approach for our website to make it easier to maintain our theme and make it easier for future developers to continue coding our theme. It also made site integration easier when adding in plugins and editing content.


Sidebar
The sidebar was created by copying the contents from template-container-sidebar.php into style.css. If any changes should made to the Sidebar, the best way to do this is to edit the code in style.css and not in the template-container-sidebar.php.


Design Decisions
Below, contains our design decisions of the learning center theme and reasons why we chose to design in that particular way.


Structure

Padding
Padding values are based on the ‘px’ value which is further explained here.
Default padding values are set in the 'structure' section of style.css.



Typography

Font
We are using the Roboto font as our primary font from Google Fonts which is published under the Open Font License meaning it is free for commercial use. The font provides an neat style which is clear and easy to read.
The fonts are set using the following variables set within style.css:
	•	$ font-family-roboto
	•	$ font-family-lato
	•	$ font-family-source-sans-pro
•	$ font-family-cardo
•	$ font-family-patua-one
•	$ font-family-source-sans-pro
•	$ font-family-open-sans



Colours

Colours play a crucial role in maintaining the composure and attractive look of the webite.
Since the logo of our client contains green as a major colour, we decided to use grey and green mainly as green meshes well with grey colour.

These colours are set using the following variables set within style.css:
	•	$ primary
	•	$ secondary
	•	$link
